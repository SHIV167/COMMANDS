Here’s how to set up your 3 Render services—Server as a Web Service; Client & Admin as Static Sites—either via the render.yaml Blueprint or by clicking through the Render UI:

1) Using render.yaml (Blueprint)
You already have a top-level render.yaml in your repo with:

yaml
CopyInsert
services:
  # 1) Node API → Web Service
  - type: web
    runtime: node
    name: EcommercePro-Server
    plan: starter
    rootDir: .
    buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
    startCommand: npm run start
    envVars:
      - key: MONGODB_URI;        sync: false
      - key: SMTP_HOST;          sync: false
      # …and so on for each server env var…

  # 2) Client → Static Site
  - type: web
    runtime: static
    name: EcommercePro-Client
    plan: starter
    rootDir: client
    buildCommand: npm install && vite build --config vite.config.ts
    staticPublishPath: dist/public
    envVars:
      - key: VITE_API_BASE_URL;  sync: false

  # 3) Admin → Static Site
  - type: web
    runtime: static
    name: EcommercePro-Admin
    plan: starter
    rootDir: admin
    buildCommand: npm install && vite build --config vite.admin.config.ts
    staticPublishPath: dist/public/admin
    envVars:
      - key: VITE_API_BASE_URL;  sync: false
Steps:

Commit & push this render.yaml to your repo root on main.
In Render Dashboard → New → Import from Git → select your repo/branch.
Render will detect three services for you—just click Create.
In each service’s Environment tab, click the sync-prompts and enter your real values.
Hit Deploy.
2) Manual UI Setup
If you’d rather point-and-click:

A) Server (Web Service)
Render Dashboard → New → Web Service
Connect your GitHub repo + main branch.
Root directory: /
Build command:
CopyInsert
npm install && npm run build
Start command:
CopyInsert
npm run start
Environment: Node (auto-detected)
Env Vars: Add each (MONGODB_URI, SMTP_HOST, …, JWT_SECRET, etc.)
Plan: Starter (free)
Create Web Service → Deploy
B) Client (Static Site)
Render Dashboard → New → Static Site
Connect your repo + branch.
Root directory: client
Build command:
CopyInsert
npm install && vite build --config vite.config.ts
Publish directory: dist/public
Env Vars:
VITE_API_BASE_URL → e.g. https://<your-api>.onrender.com/api
Plan: Starter
Create Static Site → Deploy
C) Admin (Static Site)
Same as Client, but:

Root directory: admin
Build command:
CopyInsert
npm install && vite build --config vite.admin.config.ts
Publish directory: dist/public/admin
Env Vars:
VITE_API_BASE_URL → https://<your-api>.onrender.com/admin/api
That’s it—now you’ll have t

https://ecommercepro-0ukc.onrender.com/admin/login  Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON

Your API service at https://ecommercepro-0ukc.onrender.com is only running your Node backend – it isn’t serving the admin React app unless you’ve deployed that as a separate Static Site. That’s why hitting /admin/login on your API host returns your index.html (the HTML “<!DOCTYPE…”), and any client code doing a fetch(...).json() blows up on the HTML.

You have two options:

Deploy Admin (and Client) as standalone Static Sites
– In your Render dashboard, go to New → Static Site (or click Sync Blueprint if you imported via render.yaml).
– Point one at your admin folder:
• Root directory: admin
• Build command: npm install && vite build --config vite.admin.config.ts
• Publish directory: dist/public/admin
• Env var: VITE_API_BASE_URL → your API URL (https://ecommercepro-0ukc.onrender.com)
– Once deployed you’ll get something like https://ecommercepro-admin.onrender.com. Browse to /login there for your Admin UI.
Bundle Admin into the API Web Service
If you want /admin/* to live under your API host, skip the separate Static Site and let your Express app serve the built assets. To do that:
Remove the two runtime: static services from render.yaml
Keep only the one runtime: node service
Ensure your root build script still runs both Vite builds and that in production serveStatic(app) is called (your server code already does this)
Redeploy the single Web Service – now https://ecommercepro-0ukc.onrender.com/admin/login will serve your admin HTML and your client code will make API calls back to /api/... on the same domain.
Choose whichever fits your needs. If you’d rather keep them separate, deploy the Admin as a Static Site and use its own URL (option 1). If you need them under one domain, collapse everything into your Express service (option 2).

should i need to create client and admin on render as static depoly

If you’ve already imported the render.yaml Blueprint at your repo root, you don’t need to manually click “New → Static Site” for client/admin—Render will auto-create:

• A web service (runtime: node) for your API
• Two static sites (runtime: static) for client and admin

All three are defined in your render.yaml. Just sync the Blueprint, fill in the prompted env-vars (e.g. VITE_API_BASE_URL), and hit Deploy.

If you’d rather set them up by hand instead of using the Blueprint:

In Render Dashboard → New → Static Site
Point it at your repo + main branch.
Root directory: client (or admin)
Build command: npm install && vite build --config vite.config.ts (or vite.admin.config.ts)
Publish directory: dist/public (or dist/public/admin)
Add the VITE_API_BASE_URL env-var in Settings → Environment
Create → Deploy
Repeat once for client and once for admin.

ou’re seeing that error because, by default, Render’s Static Site “Publish directory” is resolved inside whatever you set for Root Directory. If you point your Admin site at admin/ then Render will look for:

CopyInsert
<repo>/admin/dist/public/admin
but your Vite build is spitting out:

CopyInsert
<repo>/dist/public/admin
There are two quick fixes:

Deploy from your monorepo root
– In the Render UI, create (or edit) your Admin Static Site:
• Root Directory: leave blank or . (so you’re at the repo root)
• Build Command:
bash
CopyInsert in Terminal
npm install && vite build --config vite.admin.config.ts
• Publish Directory:
CopyInsert
dist/public/admin
• Add your VITE_API_BASE_URL env-var and Deploy.
Build inside admin/ and publish from there
If you really want your Static Site rooted at admin/, then you must change your Vite config so that the vite build for Admin writes into admin/dist. For example, in vite.admin.config.ts:
ts
CopyInsert
export default defineConfig({
  root: path.resolve(__dirname, 'admin'),
  build: {
    outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, 'admin', 'dist'),
    emptyOutDir: false,
  },
  // …rest of config…
});
Then in the Render UI:

text
CopyInsert
Root Directory: admin
Build Command: npm install && vite build --config vite.admin.config.ts
Publish Directory: dist
That way, after building you’ll get admin/dist and Render will pick it up.

Tip: If you’re already using the render.yaml Blueprint we set up, you don’t need any of this UI-wizardry. Just Sync Blueprint in the Render dashboard (it will run your root build, produce both dist/public and dist/public/admin, and wire up the two static sites automatically).

======================================================================================================================================================================================
For a separate Admin Static Site you must make Render look in the same dist/public/admin folder that your root build produces. You have two ways to fix it:

Via your render.yaml Blueprint (preferred)
– Ensure your Admin service block reads:
yaml
CopyInsert
- type: web
  runtime: static
  name: EcommercePro-Admin
  plan: starter
  rootDir: .
  buildCommand: npm install && npm run build   # runs both client & admin builds
  staticPublishPath: dist/public/admin
  envVars:
    - key: VITE_API_BASE_URL
      sync: false
– Commit & push that render.yaml to main.
– In Render Dashboard hit Sync Blueprint.
Render will re-run npm run build, create dist/public/admin, and your Admin site will serve correctly at its root (e.g. https://ecommercepro-admin.onrender.com/).
Or manually via the UI
Root Directory: leave blank (or .)
Build Command:
CopyInsert
npm install && npm run build
Publish Directory:
CopyInsert
dist/public/admin
Add VITE_API_BASE_URL under Environment
Deploy
Note: You don’t browse to /admin on the Admin site—you go to / on that site, because the site itself is rooted at the Admin app.


==============================================================================================================================================================================

If you really want users to go to /admin on that domain, add a rewrite in your static-site settings (or in your blueprint):

yaml
CopyInsert
routes:
  - type: rewrite
    source: "/admin/*"
    destination: "/"
but most setups simply surface the admin app at the site root.
